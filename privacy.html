  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>AussieCalc (aussiecalc.com.au) provides free Australian financial calculators. We are based in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Our calculators run entirely in your browser. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of the numbers you enter into our calculators. Your financial information never leaves your device.</p>
  <p>We may collect anonymous usage data through analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to understand how our site is used. This may include your IP address, browser type, device type, pages visited, and referring website. This data is anonymised and cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>We may use cookies and similar technologies for analytics purposes and, if applicable, to serve relevant advertisements. You can control cookie preferences through your browser settings. Our site will function normally without cookies.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We may use the following third-party services:</p>
  <p><strong>Google Analytics</strong> — to understand site usage and improve our calculators. Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
  <p><strong>Affiliate partners</strong> — some pages may contain links to third-party services (such as mortgage brokers or financial products). If you click these links, you will be subject to the third party's own privacy policy. We may receive a commission if you purchase a product through these links, at no additional cost to you.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>Our site is served over HTTPS encryption. Since we do not collect personal financial data from our calculators, there is minimal data risk. Any analytics data collected is handled by our third-party analytics provider according to their security practices.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Under the Australian Privacy Act 1988, you have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of any personal information we may hold. Since our calculators do not store personal data, this primarily applies to any information you voluntarily provide to us (such as through a contact form or email).</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our site is not directed at children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The "last updated" date at the top of this page will reflect any changes.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at: privacy@aussiecalc.com.au</p>
